# Portal del Investigador - CVN

This project is part of 
[Portal del Investigador](https://github.com/tic-ull/portal-del-investigador).

## Portal del Investigador

*Portal del Investigador* is a project promoted by the Service of Information
Technology and Communications (STIC) at University of La Laguna (ULL) which 
aims to centralize the management of scientific activities and production of the 
University researchers.

### CVN: Normalized Curriculum Vitae Management Module

This application relies on the CVN project of the *Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la 
Tecnología* (FECYT) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness 
(MINECO).

A Normalized Curriculum Vitae (CVN-PDF) is a PDF file with embedded 
CVN-XML technology, so that standardized information can be extracted for 
further processing. This extraction is the main feature of this module, but it also can import/export CVs.
