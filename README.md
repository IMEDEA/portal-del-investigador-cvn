### CVN: Management Module Normalized Curriculum Vitae

It relies on the CVN project of the *Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la 
Tecnología* (FECYT) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness 
(MINECO).

A Normalized Curriculum Vitae is a PDF file format (CVN-PDF) with embedded 
CVN-XML technology, so that standardized information can be extracted for 
further processing, this extraction is the main feature of this module that 
allows import/export of CVs.
